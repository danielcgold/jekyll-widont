# A widont plugin for Jekyll

Based originally on an idea from Shaun Inman and a Rails helper provided by mucur.name.

## Installation

Create a _plugins directory in your Jekyll site. Put the widont.rb file in the _plugins folder and restart your Jekyll process.

## Usage

The plugin works like any other standard Liquid filters. Simply pass the text you want to process through the widont keyword using a pipe character.

    <h1>{{ page.title | widont }}</h1>
